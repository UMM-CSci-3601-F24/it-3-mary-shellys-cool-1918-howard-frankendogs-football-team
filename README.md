## Summary

YIPEEEEE-Tool is a tool designed to help in solving online puzzles. We have a Anagram Solver
that you can give search parameters so you get a small handful of words back. It also allows you 
to import your own custom words if we don't have all of the words you need already. We also have 
the ability to create "rooms" that you can share with your friends. These rooms contain grids that 
are customizable for your puzzling needs. These grids update in real time so working with groups of 
any size is easy!

## The Anagram

The anagram comes with a default set of 10k words. if you want more words in the database you can 
import your own words by pressing the plus button bellow the search parameters box. Words you add will 
be part of a word group, which is something you can search by. The anagram supports searching 
for words where you do not know all of the letters. You can do this by entering underscores "\_" where 
unknown letters are in the filter by contents box when filtering by "exact". For example, if you have 
the word sell, you can use s\_\_l, to looking for words that contain an "s" followed by two letters then a "l".

## Grids

On opening our application you will have the option to work with an un-savable grid. This allows you to 
get a feel for the controls without making or entering a room.

### Grid Controls

When you type, your letters will go right into the grid. You can change the direction that your typing by 
clicking on the type direction toggle. Wether your direction is always deleting to the left, or wether 
it is linked to your type direction is controlled by the delete direction toggle. By default it deletes to 
the left. You can also move across the grid by using the arrow keys
You can customize the grid by holding ctrl while pressing the arrow keys. This wil "bold" a edge and make 
it black, which also stops you from typing through it. If all of a cells edges are bold, the whole cell becomes 
black. To highlight a cell, all you have to do is right click. If you alt + left click on a blacked out cell, the 
cells edges stay black, while the cell itself is editable again.

### Rooms for Grids Explained

To save or access previously saved grids create a new room on the home page or have someone in a room share a link. 
Once inside of a grid if multiple people are looking a the same grid then the grid will update in real time so 
multiple people can edit it at once. These grids are highly customizable as you can make them as small/large as you need. 
The grids can also be uneven sizes, but they still have to be rectangles.
